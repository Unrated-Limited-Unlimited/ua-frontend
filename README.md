# This is the Frontend for Unrated: The whiskey rating app.
This is the frontend for Unrated, an application created in the context of the subject DAT251 at HVL (Western Norway University of Applied Sciences) 


The frontend is created using SvelteKit, and is planned to have tests written in Cypress in the future.


## Setup

In order to set the backend URL to something other than localhost:8000, you can create a `.env` file in the root of the project. 
`.env.example` contains examples of possible variables.
